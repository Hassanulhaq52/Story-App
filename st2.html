        People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems every time. One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter.
        After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled.
        “You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem?” </p>
<h3>Moral of the story: </h3>
    <p>Worrying won’t solve your problems, it’ll just waste your time and energy. </p>
